TODO
=========================
- Database design not up-to-date:
	-- Call flows, Targets and Campaigns are not taken into consideration; 
	-- association between Service and Site should be re-designed; 
	-- views might be created for each customer 
	
- User account synchronization for CCDM and other associated applications
- Multi-language interface
- Time zone conversion
